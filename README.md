### Project Summary

This project utilizes Hilt for dependency injection, follows the MVVM architecture pattern, and incorporates DataStore for data persistence in an Android application. Hilt simplifies the process of dependency injection by generating the code for you, MVVM separates the UI and business logic into separate components for better maintainability, and DataStore provides a lightweight and efficient way to store key-value pairs. Together, these technologies can provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable Android applications.
